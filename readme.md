👋 Hello! I'm a passionate student with a love for JavaScript and TypeScript projects, and a strong desire to delve into native development.

📚 Currently studying and exploring the exciting world of computer science, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to sharpen my skills and broaden my knowledge in the field.

💻 My journey began with JavaScript, where I discovered the power and flexibility of web development. I've since honed my skills in creating dynamic and interactive web applications using popular frameworks like React and Angular.

🚀 Intrigued by the prospects of native development, I'm eager to embark on new challenges and expand my expertise to build powerful, high-performance applications for desktop and mobile platforms.

🌱 Embracing a growth mindset, I'm always on the lookout for innovative technologies and industry best practices. I enjoy collaborating with like-minded individuals and contributing to open-source projects, as it allows me to learn from others and share my own experiences.

🔨 When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me reading up on the latest tech trends or experimenting with personal projects to enhance my skills. I also enjoy attending tech meetups and hackathons, where I can connect with fellow developers and immerse myself in a creative and collaborative environment.

🤝 Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects, share knowledge, and make a positive impact together. Feel free to reach out to me to discuss anything related to JavaScript, TypeScript, or native development. I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges!
